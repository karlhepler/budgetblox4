DATA CONCEPTS
==============

##BUDGETS

###What information would I like to know about the budget?
1. Name
2. The monthly limit
3. How much of the monthly limit is available to _be spent_
4. Amount spent
5. How much money is left

> So, it seems that #2 and #3 are closely related... I think the way I came up with this before was
to just have a graph showing this relationship. So basically, the data could be represented like this:
* Name
* Monthly limit
* Graphed percentage of monthly limit vs. the tangible limit for this month
* Amount spent
* What's left

It's almost like there are two limits:
* The ideal limit
* The real limit

Both are useful bits of information on their own right, but so much related that I think they need to
be represented in graph form... I think the ideal limit should be dominant

I also need to know if this budget is a rollover budget or if it is a compounding budget

In addition to that, it may also be useful to list the banks and show the amounts this budget takes from each bank

I will also need to be able to click somewhere in the budget view GUI to filter out the transactions to only
show transactions for that budget
